                 SCIM Roles and Entitlements Extension
               draft-ietf-scim-roles-entitlements-latest

Abstract

   The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol's
   schema RFC RFC7643 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643)
   defines the complex core schema attributes "roles" and
   "entitlements".  For both of these concepts, frequently only a
   predetermined set of values are accepted by a SCIM service provider.
   The values that are accepted may vary per customer or tenant based on
   customizable configuration in the service provider's application or
   based on other criteria such as what services have been purchased.
   This document defines an extension to the SCIM 2.0 standard to allow
   SCIM service providers to represent available data pertaining to
   roles and entitlements so that SCIM clients can consume this
   information and provide easier management of role and entitlement
   assignments.

1.  Introduction

   The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol's
   schema RFC RFC7643 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643)
   defines the complex core schema attributes "roles" and
   "entitlements".  For both of these concepts, frequently only a
   predetermined set of values are accepted by a SCIM service provider.
   Available roles and entitlements may change based on a variety of
   factors, such as what features are enabled or what customizations
   have been made in a specific instance of a multi-tenant application.
   The core SCIM 2.0 RFC documents (RFC7642, RFC7643 and RFC 7644) do
   not provide a method for retrieving the available roles or
   entitlements as part of the SCIM 2.0 standard.

   In order to allow for SCIM clients to avoid easily predictable errors
   when interacting with SCIM service providers, this document aims to
   provide a method for SCIM service providers to provide data on what
   roles and/or entitlements are available so that SCIM clients can
   consume this data to more efficiently manage resources between
   directories.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Roles and Entitlements

   The Roles and Entitlements SCIM Extension consists of two new
   resource types, /Roles and /Entitlements, as well as accompanying
   ServiceProviderConfig details to advertise support for this
   extension.

3.1.  ServiceProviderConfig Extension

   SCIM endpoints that have implemented one or both of the endpoints
   from this extension MUST advertise which elements are implemented in
   the ServiceProviderConfig endpoint as defined:

   RolesAndEntitlements
       A complex type that specifies Roles and Entitlements extension
       configuration options. REQUIRED.

       roles
           A complex type that specifies configuration options
           related to the Roles resource type. REQUIRED.

           enabled
               A boolean type that indicates if the SCIM service
               provider supports the /Roles endpoint defined
               in this extension. REQUIRED.

           multipleRolesSupported
               A boolean type that indicates if the SCIM service
               provider supports multiple values for the "roles"
               attribute on the User resource. REQUIRED.

           primarySupported
               A boolean type that indicates if the SCIM service
               provider supports the "primary" sub-attribute for
               the "roles" attribute on the User resource. REQUIRED.

           typeSupported
               A boolean type that indicates if the SCIM service
               provider supports the "type" sub-attribute for
               the "roles" attribute on the User resource. REQUIRED.

       entitlements
           A complex type that specifies configuration options
           related to the Entitlements resource type. REQUIRED.

           enabled
               A boolean type that indicates if the SCIM service
               provider supports the /Entitlements endpoint defined
               in this extension. REQUIRED.

           multipleEntitlementsSupported
               A boolean type that indicates if the SCIM service
               provider supports multiple values for the
               "entitlements" attribute on the User resource.
               REQUIRED.

           primarySupported
               A boolean type that indicates if the SCIM service
               provider supports the "primary" sub-attribute for
               the "entitlements" attribute on the User resource.
               REQUIRED.

           typeSupported
               A boolean type that indicates if the SCIM service
               provider supports the "type" sub-attribute for
               the "entitlements" attribute on the User resource.
               REQUIRED.

3.2.  Roles Resource Schema

   The /Roles resource type has a schema consisting of most of the
   attributes defined for the User resource's complex attribute "roles"
   in RFC7643 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643), as well
   as an additional "Enabled" attribute so that SCIM service providers
   can indicate if the role is currently enabled and intended for use in
   their service.

   The following singular attributes are defined:

   value
       The value of a role. REQUIRED.

   display
       A human-readable name, primarily used for display purposes.
       OPTIONAL.

   type
       A label indicating the role's function.  OPTIONAL

   enabled
       A boolean type that indicates if the role is enabled and usable
       in the SCIM service provider's system.  REQUIRED.

   limitedAssignmentsPermitted
       A boolean type that indicates if a limited number of users may
       be assigned this role. A value of false should be interpreted
       as no numerical restriction on the number of users that may
       hold this role. Other restrictions may exist.  RECOMMENDED.

   totalAssignmentsPermitted
       An integer type that indicates how many users may be
       assigned this role, either directly or inherited.
       OPTIONAL, but RECOMMENDED if assignments are restricted
       to a certain number.

   totalAssignmentsUsed
       An integer type that indicates how many users are currently
        assigned this role, either directly or inherited.
        OPTIONAL, but RECOMMENDED if assignments are restricted
        to a certain number.

   Additionally, the following multi-valued attributes are defined:

   containedBy
       A list of "parent" roles that contain a superset of
       permissions including those granted by this role.
       OPTIONAL.

   contains
       A list of "child" roles that this role grants the rights of.
       OPTIONAL.

3.3.  Entitlements Resource Schema

   The /Entitlements resource type has a schema consisting of most of
   the attributes defined for the User resource's complex attribute
   "entitlements" in RFC7643 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/
   rfc7643), as well as an additional "Enabled" attribute so that SCIM
   service providers can indicate if the entitlement is currently
   enabled and intended for use in their service.

   The following singular attributes are defined:

   value
       The value of an entitlement. REQUIRED.

   display
       A human-readable name, primarily used for display purposes.
       OPTIONAL.

   type
       A label indicating the entitlement's function. OPTIONAL.

   enabled
       A boolean type that indicates if the entitlement is enabled
       and usable in the SCIM service provider's system. REQUIRED.

   limitedAssignmentsPermitted
       A boolean type that indicates if a limited number of users may
       be assigned this entitlement. A value of false should be
       interpreted as no numerical restriction on the number of users
       that may hold this entitlement. Other restrictions may exist.
       RECOMMENDED.

   totalAssignmentsPermitted
       An integer type that indicates how many users may be assigned
       this entitlement, either directly or inherited.  OPTIONAL, but
       RECOMMENDED if limitedAssignmentsPermitted is true.

   totalAssignmentsUsed
       An integer type that indicates how many users are currently
       assigned this entitlement, either directly or inherited.
       OPTIONAL, but RECOMMENDED if limitedAssignmentsPermitted is true.

   Additionally, the following multi-valued attributes are defined:

   containedBy
       A list of "parent" entitlements that contain a superset of
       permissions including those granted by this entitlement.
       OPTIONAL.

   contains
       A list of "child" entitlements that this entitlement grants
       the rights of.  OPTIONAL.

   Author's note: Above descriptions for contains and containedBy need
   work to make clearer, and probably an explanatory section as well.
